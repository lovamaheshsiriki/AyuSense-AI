## 🧠 Problem Statement

Doctors in India spend 40–50% of their consultation time on manual documentation.  
Additionally, many patients struggle to clearly communicate symptoms due to language barriers and limited medical literacy.

This leads to:
- Delayed diagnosis
- Repeated tests
- Increased workload
- Reduced healthcare efficiency

## 💡 Our Solution

AyuSense AI enables patients to describe symptoms in their native language through voice input.  
The system converts conversations into structured clinical summaries using AI and provides doctors with instant, actionable insights.
